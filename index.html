        <span class="w3-large"><b>1. Challenges for Elderly Travelers</b></span><br>
        <p>A new study by the Transportation Research Board’s Airport Cooperative Research Program shows 
        that elderly passengers’ ability to navigate airports is negatively affected by various aging-related issues. 
        Two of the most prevalent challenges aging travelers face in airports are <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nap.edu/catalog/22417/impacts-of-aging-travelers-on-airports">way-finding and fatigue</a>. 
        </p>
        <span class="w3-large"><b>2. Growing Demand for Special Assistance</b></span><br>
        <p>According to the <a target="_blank" href="http://publicapps.caa.co.uk/docs/33/20180711%20CAP1679%20FINAL.pdf">2017/18 Accessibility Report</a>, in 2017 alone, over 3 million requests were made for assistance at UK 
        airports. That number is only expected to rise at a rate of around double that of the general passenger growth. <br>
        Furthermore, the <a target="_blank" href="http://publicapps.caa.co.uk/docs/33/CAP1821.pdf">2018/19 Accessibility Report</a> reports that a 
        record 3.7 million passengers were assisted at 31 UK airports between 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019. 
        Since 2014 the number of passengers assisted increased by 49% while overall passenger numbers increased by 25%.
        </p>

        <span class="w3-large"><b>3. Customer Satisfaction</b></span><br>
        <p> Current arrangements in UK airports have proven to be quite poor in terms of customer satisfaction. 
        The <a target="_blank" href="http://publicapps.caa.co.uk/docs/33/20180711%20CAP1679%20FINAL.pdf">2017/18 Accessibility Report</a> states, <br>
        "<i>Disappointingly we have classified London Gatwick, London Stansted, and Birmingham as 'needs improvement' 
        and one airport, Manchester, as ‘poor’.  Information provided to us shows that disabled passengers and those 
        with reduced mobility took significantly longer to move through the airport than other passengers, with an unacceptable 
        number of disabled and reduced mobility passengers waiting more than twenty minutes for assistance with, in some cases, 
        passengers left waiting for assistance for more than an hour</i>".<br>
        
        The tells us that the current means of assistance do not ensure a 100% customer satisfaction as they heavily rely on human involvement.
        </p>

        <span class="w3-large"><b>4. Lack of Services to Address the Challenges</b></span><br>
        <p> While there are several robotic assistants on the market, 
        none of them are targeted specifically towards the elderly. Examples of such products include KLM Care-e, 
        which can assist with carrying luggage but this does not address the issue of exhaustion while navigating a large airport. 
        Another example is that of AIRSTAR, the robotic assistant present at Incheon, South Korea. 
        While it is able to give indications to travelers and even guide them to their destination, it still does 
        not address the aforementioned issue.

            The purpose the system serves is to combine mobility assistance with way-finding. 
            Thus, the intended setup of the product is to be available for use for travelers after passing airport security. 
            From there, IAN can scan the traveler's boarding pass, provide them with their flight information and take them to their desired
            destination in the airport.

          John is 65 years old and he traveled for hours to reach the airport for his flight. 
          He is feeling exhausted and the airport is large. His gate and restaurants are a long way 
          from airport security and he would appreciate some help getting there. 
          However, he did not request special assistance prior to his arrival, and hence does not have priority and will have to wait until a member of stuff becomes available. 
          John uses IAN to take him to any point of interest within the airport without the need for human involvement. </p>

          Jane is 70 years old and has just arrived in the airport for her flight. 
          Most airports make her nervous as she is always having a hard time navigating them, in particular she struggles with finding her way to 
          the restaurants and toilets. Jane uses IAN, chooses her desired point of interest and she is comfortably taken there. 
          She is relieved that she doesn't need to ask around or keep looking at the signs to find her way. IAN has also informed her of a change in her flight status, 
          saving her the stress of constantly looking out for new updates from airport staff. </p>

      <span class="w3-large"><b> Safety Enhancements</b></span><br>
        <p>For the 4th sprint, pre-COVID-19, we had started preparing a Python script that recieves a 
        video stream from a camera located in the gap between the back support of the user seat and the seat foundation. The purpose of
        this setup is to detect when the user is sitting down and when they are not - depending on the light intensity the camera recieves.
        This was supposed to be a safety feature to ensure the robot never moves when it's unsafe to do so.</p>

        <span class="w3-large"><b> Navigation Enhancements</b></span><br>
        <p>During our scalability research we came across a more efficient Navigation algorithm, 
        which will allow our robot to navigate obstacles in a safer, more realistic way – given a sufficient amount of time and resources. 
        Our research suggests that 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322447662_Generalized_Voronoi_Diagram_application_to_Turtlebot_Navigation_in_ROS">Generalized Voronoi Diagrams (GVD) could be applied to Turtlebot navigation in ROS</a>. 
        Without going into technical details, this research concluded that the current implementation, using Dijkstra’s method, might force 
        the robot to abort if an obstacle were to appear when the robot was turning, whereas the GVD algorithm would plan a safe 
        route around it. This research is particularly relevant to our system since airports have many corridors, and thus IAN would 
        have to make turns frequently.</p> 

        <span class="w3-large"><b> Navigating Multiple Floors</b></span><br>
        <p>A potential further development of IAN is to navigate buildings with multiple floors. 
        Multiple airports host restaurants and shops on different building floors than the departure gates. 
        One way to do this is to incorporate IAN's functionalities with Airport lifts, although this would require further research. </p>

        <span class="w3-large"><b> Multiple Languages</b></span><br>
        <p>Available only in English now, one of the next steps we intend to take is to make our product 
        accessible for everyone from around the globe. For this, we plan to integrate many more languages, 
        such that any traveler, no matter which language they speak, would have a similar level of accessibility to IAN.</p>

        <span class="w3-large"><b> Voice commands & Text-to-speech</b></span><br>
        <p>While designed with the elderly in mind, our product range could be expanded to provide assistive
        services to other groups. One of our main future goals is to make airports more comfortable for those
        who are visually impaired. With some modifications, we plan to adapt the current product to include
        voice accessibility and screen reading such that those who have sight difficulties would have a similar
        level of accessibility to IAN</p>

        <span class="w3-large"><b> Market Transferability</b></span><br>
        <p>As of now, our primary customers are airports. However, IAN can easily be adapted to satisfy 
        different market segments. From insurance companies that provide services to injured workers to 
        firms that want to make their offices accessible to their disabled employees. We can vouch that 
        IAN has the potential to fulfill all requests of special assistance in a building environment. </p>

        <br>
        <span class="w3-large"><b> Increased Airport Accessibility </b></span><br>
        <p>Airports provide many accessibility features but sometimes they can be hard to 
        access and may need booking in advance. IAN provides assistance as soon as you pass security without needing a reservation. </p>

        <span class="w3-large"><b> Attracting More Customers  </b></span><br>
        <p>Airports can be daunting to those with fatigue challenges and way-finding difficulties. Making airports more accessible and easy to navigate can only encourage those customers to air travel more frequently.</p> 
      
        <span class="w3-large"><b> Reduced Costs </b></span><br>
        <p>Under European Law airports are required to provide special assistance to passengers, free of charge. Each airport calculates a passenger with reduced mobility (PRM) charge which is included in the airport tax. Our product can help passengers move to specified locations without the need for staff involvement and help airports reduce special assistance related costs.</p> 
        <p>After analyzing the average salaries of on-the-ground airline staff (of which those providing the wheelchair service are a subset) and estimating the likely costs of our products' manufacturing and maintenance, we speculate that having IAN as part of an airport's ecosystem could reduce net costs (in the range of 30%-50% per annum) by hiring less airline staff to provide such assistance. </p>

        EU Regulation [1107/2006] states that support given by airports and airlines to disabled people traveling
        must be free. Each airport calculates a passenger with reduced mobility (PRM) charge which is included in
        the airport tax and then added to the total cost of every ticket airlines sell. Note that, 
        requests for assistance have been growing at a pace of 12 percent year on year. In simpler words, if the 
        PRM charge is not increased every year, there is less money to assist more passengers.
        <br><br>
        On average, all UK airports charge a fee of 85 Pence to 1 Pound on all passengers using the airport.In 2018,
        more than 292M passengers flew in/out of the UK [Aviation statistics: data tables (AVI)] costing 
        between £43.8m - £87.6m in added air tax for special assistance arrangements.
        <br><br>
        Our product can reduce those costs [ argument on how ]. Reduced RPM charge will attract more airlines for
        the airport and consequently more travelers, increasing at the same time the profits of the airport, minimizing
        time and resources allocated to special assistance.[ this need fixing ]

        <span class="w3-large"><b>1. Making a Map</b></span><br>
        The <b>SLAM</b> (<b>Simultaneous Localization and Mapping</b>) is a technique to draw a map by estimating the 
        current location in an arbitrary space. Using SLAM we can create a 2-D occupancy grid map (like a building floorplan) 
        from laser and pose data collected by a mobile robot. The result of this operation was the map used for navigation.

        <span class="w3-large" ><b>2. Navigation with RViz</b></span><br>
        The goal of navigation is to move the robot from a location to a specified destination 
        in a given environment. For this purpose, a map that contains the geometric information of objects 
        and walls of the given environment is required. As described earlier, using SLAM, the 
        map was created with the distance information obtained by the sensor and the pose information of the Turtlebot itself.
        In this phase, we used RViz to: <br><br>
        
        
        • <b>estimate the initial position</b>: for the Turtlebot to navigate autonomously inside the area of the given map, 
        the initial position of the Turtlebot must be given. This was done using the visual tool RViz by drawing an arrow in the map 
        to determine the orientation and position of the Turtlebot inside the environment.  <br><br>
        
        <p class="w3-right" style="width: 40%; margin-right: 10%; margin-top: 4%; text-align: left;">
        • <b>send the navigation goal</b>: similiar to the initial position estimate, RViz is used to draw an arrow in the map 
        to determine the goal position and orientation of the turtlebot. <br><br>
        The Turtlebot will create a path to avoid obstacles to its destination based on the map and data from its sensor. 
        Then, the Turtlebot moves along the path. At this time, even if an obstacle is suddenly detected, 
        the Turtlebot moves to the target point avoiding the obstacle.

        <span class="w3-large"><b>3. Parameter Tuning</b></span><br>
        One of the most difficult challenges we faced in the Navigation team was improving 
        the navigation's behavior. Even though the navigation was functional, it was not accurate. 
        To alleviate that, we had to tune certain parameters which proved to be a challenging task as we had to constantly 
        evaluate the effect of each parameter. Our goal was to establish a combination of parameters that would provide 
        the optimal navigation behavior. In technical terms, the job of the navigation package is to produce a safe path 
        for the Turtlebot to execute, by processing data from odometry, sensors and the environment map. 
        Optimizing the performance of this navigation package requires some fine-tuning of these parameters.
        Tuned parameters include: <br><br>
    
        
        </p>
        <p class="w3-right" style="width: 40%; margin-right: 10%; margin-top: 4%; text-align: left;">
        • <b>sim_time</b>: the time allowed for the robot to examine each possible velocity value and pick the highest-scored trajectory. <br>
        • <b>path_distance_bias</b>: is the weight for how much the local planner should stay close to the global path. It makes 
        the navigation smoother as it is more attached to the global planner's path. <br>
        • <b>yaw_goal_tolerance</b>: the tolerance in radians for the controller in rotation when achieving its goal. <br>
        • <b>xy_goal_tolerance</b>: the tolerance in meters for the controller in the x and y distances when achieving a goal. <br>
        • <b>max_vel_x, min_vel_x</b>: range of the velocity the robot can take. <br>
        • <b>inflation_radius, cost_scaling_factor</b>: the two parameters control how far the robot aims to be from obstacles while it moves. The first controls 
        how far away the zero cost point is from the obstacle. The second is inversely proportional to the cost of a cell.

        <span class="w3-large"><b>4. Navigation Scripting</b></span><br>
        The next step after the navigation optimization was to replace the visual tool RViz, which allowed us to publish the initial position as well as the destination <i>manually</i>. 
        The python scripts we have written use packages like <b>rospy, move_base_msgs.msg, actionlib, actionlib_msgs</b>, and <b>geometry_msgs</b> to manipulate 
        the message types for publishing. These libraries give us access to the message parameters.
        The <b>actionlib</b> library allows us to create a client Node to the <b>MoveBaseAction</b> interface. Essentially, 
        the <b>MoveBaseAction</b> accepts goals from clients and attempts to move the Turtlebot to the specified position/orientation in the world. 
        Using the client node, we create a goal message and publish it to that interface, which is essentially commanding the Turtlebot 
        to move towards that goal. 
        </p>
        <p class="w3-right" style="width: 40%; margin-right: 10%; margin-top: 3.7%; text-align: left;">
        With the same reasoning, we used the relevant interfaces to publish the initial position of the Turtlebot. 
        For the pausing functionality, we are using the <b>MoveBaseAction</b> interface to cancel all the goals given to the turtlebot 
        and just resend the previous destination when the user resumes.
        <br><br>
        Since we have the navigation node running behind the scenes we do not need to write an external script for the robot to plan a 
        route to the destination, avoid obstacles and in general plan its movements smartly. We took advantage of the <b>amcl</b> module 
        that does that for us by just publishing the end goal and by allowing the module to do the rest (i.e. plan a route for the robot). 
        The only thing the scripts have replaced is the need to use the visual tool RViz to pinpoint the initial position and the goal location/orientation.

        <span class="w3-large"><b>5. Live Location Tracking</b></span><br>
         The last milestone of the Navigation team was to broadcast the location of the Turtlebot 
         in a map in the UI while navigating. However, this proved to be another challenge as there were no already-existing 
         packages for a live-tracking feature, so this was manually implemented by the team. Using the ROS topic, <b>/move_base/feedback</b>, 
         we were able to receive the Turtlebot's location during navigation 
         from the Turtlebot's own map of the arena. We also had a model map of the arena on the UI. We scaled and normalized the two maps in 
         order to broadcast the Turtlebot's location onto the UI map.

      The next step after the migration of the DB on the Server Pi was to establish a secure and reliable communication channel between the User Pi and the Server Pi

      An important functionality of our product is to notify the user that a change has occurred to their flight.  
      To accomplish that, we have the Server Pi "listening" for any change in the records of the DB that concern the current user of the system. 
      If there is a change in their flight information, the Server Pi writes those changes to a file in the User Pi. Similar to the Server Pi, 
      the User Pi is "listening" for a modification in that file. As soon as it detects that the file has been modified, it updates the current user
       using a pop-up window in the UI.

      <span class="w3-large"><b>5. Challenges</b></span><br>
      A particular challenge faced by the DB/Scanning team was getting the User Pi and the Server Pi to 
      communicate harmoniously in order to provide the user with live updates when the user's flight information change.
      The arrangement for the communication, initially, was TCP using sockets. The problem with here is that the network the two Pi's would 
      communicate over was supported by multiple routers. As such, the TCP socket communication, in particular, would work at times and wouldn't work at other times depending on
      the location of the two Pi's in the room. </p>
      <p class="w3-right" style="width: 40%; margin-right: 5%; text-align: left; margin-top: 3.5%;">
      Because of this unpredictability, we found another method that is not disturbed by the multi-router setup for communication. The method involved 
      sharing the SSH-keys of the Pi's with each other and communicating by the means of SSH sessions. 
      For example, when the User Pi scans the boarding pass, it would SSH into the Server Pi with the flight and user id's, to run a script that 
      constantly scans for changes to the user flight.

  Users interact with IAN using a simple, modern-looking UI on a Pi touchscreen. We created the UI using Qt, a free, open source, cross platform toolkit, and its Python bindings PyQt. 
  We designed the UI using the QtDesigner tool and integrated the backend code with the other functionality of IAN (scanning, database retrieval, navigation) with several Python scripts.
  We focused on <b>usability</b> - using a large sans serif font for readablity and symbols over words. 
  We chose colours suitable for colourblind users, and included a help page and a call for help button. These steps ensure IAN is 
  intuitive as possible for the elderly. <br><br>

<p class="w3-center " >
    Autonomous navigation is the most significant functionality of our product. <br>
    For this reason, it was under regular re-evaluation and improvement.
  </p>

    <p class="w3-quarter " style="margin:2%;  width:40%">
    <span class="w3-large"><b>1. Test Purpose</b></span><br>
      The navigation functionality needed to reach an acceptable standard to be formally evaluated against our product's set standards.
    </p>

    <p class="w3-quarter w3-left" style="margin:2%;  width:40%; margin-left: 5%;">
      <span class="w3-large"><b>2. Test Procedure</b></span><br>
        Initially, even though the Turtlebot's navigation was functional,
         we noticed that the planning and movement of the robot were inaccurate. 
         The robot failed to reach its given destination, kept hitting the walls and obstacles even though 
         they were clearly shown on the sensor map, went past the goals without stopping or was unable to assume the instructed orientation. 
         For us to overcome these issues, the Navigation team had to constantly experiment with the Navigation Parameters (see the "How it Works" section). 
         With each tuning, we informally evaluated the performance of the navigation and repeated the process.
      </p>

    <p class="w3-quarter w3-left" style="margin:2%;  width:40%; margin-top: -8%;">
    <span class="w3-large"><b>3. Test Results</b></span><br>
      After a lot of experimentation and informal evaluation of the navigation behavior, 
      the team established a combination of parameters that would provide the optimal navigation behavior.
    </p>

  <p class="w3-center w3-large">Consistency in Travel Time</p>
<div style="padding:40px 10px; display:inline-block;">

<p class="w3-quarter w3-left " style="margin:2%;  width:40%;  margin-left: 10%;"> 
<span class="w3-large"><b>1. Test Purpose</b></span><br>
The next step was to evaluate the consistency of the travel time of the Turtlebot. 
We needed to ensure that the Turtlebot will be consistent in its travel time as well as the path chosen for 
any given destination assuming the same initial position and environment.  Have in mind that between the second and third sprint, 
the user seat and an extra level was installed on the Turtlebot, jeopardizing its consistency. This evaluation would provide insights on 
how much the Turtlebot was affected in terms of consistency with the additional modifications. 
</p>

<p class="w3-quarter w3-left " style="margin:2%;  width:40%"> 
<span class="w3-large"><b>2. Test Procedure</b></span><br>
During the second sprint, we had only 3 destinations available for the Turtlebot whereas, during the third sprint, 
our destinations grew to 10. For each hub-to-point-of-interest (<b>where the hub is the starting position of the Turtlebot</b>) journey, 20 tests were carried out to 
measure the time taken for the Turtlebot to travel (after receiving the command to move to the destination) 
from its hub to the specified destination. We then calculated the average of the travel times for each journey, 
and plotted the deviation of each test from its respective average journey time. <b>In the graph on the left, we have the tests for the second sprint,
and on the right we have the tests for the third sprint.</b>

  <span class="w3-large"><b>3. Test Results</b></span><br>
  From the analysis, we can observe that most of <b>the travel times for each journey deviated from their 
  respective averages in the margin of 5%</b>. Furthermore, the consistency of the Turtlebot in terms of travel time remained stable. 
  Our product's time consistency is of major importance, as for customers to trust our product in a real-world scenario,
   we need to ensure that it is reliable and capable of carrying passengers to their destination on time.

<p class="w3-center w3-large">Accuracy of the Final Position for Each Journey</p>
<div style="padding:40px 10px;  display:inline-block;">
<p class="w3-quarter w3-left " style="margin:2%;  width:40%; margin-left: 10%;"> 
<span class="w3-large"><b>1. Test Purpose</b></span><br>
The last step was to evaluate the accuracy of the Turtlebot's final position (coordinates given in the database) from the actual, tested final position for each journey. 
Have in mind that during our navigation parameter tuning, we manually allowed the Turtlebot a tolerance of 25cm to reach the destination (using the <i>xy_goal_tolerance</i> parameter), 
meaning that within a 25cm radius of the given coordinates the Turtlebot would stop and assume it has reached its destination.
</p>

<p class="w3-quarter w3-left " style="margin:2%;  width:40%; "> 
<span class="w3-large"><b>2. Test Procedure</b></span><br>
For each hub-to-point-of-interest journey, 20 tests were carried out. When the Turtlebot reached the destination, 
we recorded its position and calculated the difference between the given coordinates and the actual coordinates. 
<b>Note that the distance the Turtlebot traveled, on any journey, was between 1.5m to 5.5m</b>.
</p> <br>

<p class="w3-quarter w3-left " style="margin:2%;  width:70%; margin-left: 10%;"> 
<span class="w3-large"><b>3. Test Results</b></span><br>
Our measurements show that <b>the maximum difference in disparity we get is 5cm</b>, which we deem to be acceptable. 
In a real-world scenario, our product will be scaled up, meaning that these measurements will change. However, 
we estimate that the accuracy of the localization of the Turtlebot will not, as the same principles will be used even 
if the distance traveled is larger. We allow a minor tolerance for the Turtlebot keeping in mind that there isn't a 
specific spot for the airport point-of-interest but rather a general area for the user to arrive at.

<p class="w3-center w3-large">UI User Testing</p>
<div style="padding:10px 16px;  display:inline-block;">
<p class="w3-quarter w3-left" style="margin:2%;  width:40%; margin-left: 10%;">
 <span class="w3-large"><b>1. Testing Procedure</b></span><br>
 We tested our user interface on 5 participants over the age of 50. 
 We gave context to the UI by explaining what IAN is and what it does physically.
 We then asked the participants to think aloud (using the think-aloud protocol) while using the UI and then asked them the 
 following directed questions: <br><br>
 • Did you find anything confusing or misleading? <br>
 • At any point were you stuck? <br>
 • What did you think of the design? <br>
 • Do you have any other comments or suggestions? <br>
</p>
<p class="w3-quarter w3-right" style="margin:2%;  width:40%; ">
<span class="w3-large"><b>2. Findings</b></span><br>
 All of the participants found the help pages easy to follow, and at no point were any of them were stuck. 
 Some of the participants noted their appreciation of how simple the design was. 4 out of the 5 users found 
 the concept of the pause button confusing, and 2 users were also confused by the map on the UI. <br><br>

 Some users provided suggestions for improvement on the text content of several of the UI buttons or pages,
 most of which we have already incorporated into the UI: <br><br> 
 • 'Take Me Somewhere' → 'Go Somewhere' <br>
 • 'Goal' → 'Destination' <br>
 • 'Your Info' → 'Your Flight' <br>
 • Add personal messages such as 'Enjoy your flight, {name}!'. <br>
 • Add a comment on the 'Where' page which informs the user that they will be able to change their mind on the destination. <br>
 • The airport help desk should be a destination option.
</p>
</div>

<div style="padding:10px 16px;  display:inline-block;">
<p class="w3-quarter w3-left" style="margin:2%; margin-top: -12%;  width:40%; margin-left: 10%;">
 <span class="w3-large"><b>3. Improvements</b></span><br>
 We learned from our testing that we took for granted intuitive understanding of common design elements. 
 Many features of our UI weren't confusing for us (the team) or our peers (others on the course), but they 
 were for the older people we tested on - those who aren't as fluent with technology. So we decided to make 
 the following changes to help even the most technologically illiterate understand IAN and to use the system with confidence: <br><br>

• A 'Welcome to IAN' screen and two short introduction screens to familiarise new users with IAN. <br>
• A friendlier message asking users to scan their boarding pass, and introducing the functionality of the help and exit buttons. <br>
• Calling the user by their name once their flight details have been retrieved, and wishing them a safe flight once their journey 
is over makes the system less intimidating and more personal. <br>
• Changing the 'Take Me Somewhere' button to the clearer 'Go Somewhere'.<br>
• Renaming 'Your Info' to the 'Your Flight'.<br>
• Warning the user IAN will begin moving once they confirm their destination.<br>
• Changing the 'Pause' button to one that uses the word pause instead of the pause symbol for more obvious functionality.<br>
• Always showing the 'New Goal' button to the user.<br>
• Providing confirmation to the user once they have reached their destination.

<p class="w3-quarter w3-left" style="margin:2%;  width:40%; margin-left: 10%;">
 <span class="w3-large"><b>1. Current Human Service Cost:</b></span><br>
 We start by making a few assumptions about the market: <br><br>
 &nbsp; • According to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.caa.co.uk/News/UK-Civil-Aviation-Authority-reports-on-disabled-access-at-UK-airports/">UK Civil Aviation Authority</a>, 
 there was a record number of 3.7 million requests for assistance at UK airports in the latest year. <br>
&nbsp; • We presume it takes one airport staff member a working hour to fulfill such an assistance request. <br>
&nbsp; • According to Glassdoor, British Airways' customer service staff on the ground make between £10-13/hour. We will presume it's £15/hr for the sake of making a safer estimate.<br><br>

We presume that our product can only fulfill half of those requests, which are 1,850,000 requests a year. Given those assumptions, we estimate the cost of responding to those 3.7 million requests to be <b>1,850,000 x £15 = £27,750,000</b>.
</p>

<p class="w3-quarter w3-right" style="margin:2%;  width:40%; ">
<span class="w3-large"><b>2. Product Units Estimate</b></span><br>
 We now have to make assumptions about the units of the product we would produce per annum. 
 Considering there are 3.7 million mobility assistance requests per year (365 days), that amounts to around 10,136 such requests a day. 
 We make another assumption here that our product can only cater to half of those, so 5,000 requests a day. 
 If we also presume a completely uniform distribution of those requests on the 24 hours of the day, we arrive at 208 requests per hour. 
 To recap, that is <b>208 mobility requests that our product can fulfill per hour around the UK</b>. 
 Therefore, it makes sense to produce 208 units in the first year and release 208 of the enhanced version of the product each following year.

    &nbsp; • FTE 1.0 – CTO (technical) – Salary Costs = £35,000 pa. <br>
    &nbsp; • FTE 1.0 – Engineer (robotics) – Salary Costs = £30,000 pa.<br>
    &nbsp; • FTE 1.0 – Software Developer – Salary Costs = £30,000 pa.<br>
    &nbsp; • FTE 1.0 – Sales Manager – Salary Costs = £25,000 pa.<br>
    &nbsp; • Employers contributions (for staff, e.g., pensions, bonuses, employers NI, appreciation about 20% of staff costs): £26,000 pa.<br>
    Lease / Rent / Office Space Costs: £20,000 pa.<br>
    Equipment Lease (e.g. long-term equipment for building robots etc.): £15,000 pa.<br>
    Insurance (liability, indemnity, employers, buildings cover, contents & stock, legal expenses, theft, criminal damages, etc.): £2,000 pa.<br>

  &nbsp; • We will take the total for all units (208) to be the upper bound of all the costs above.<br>
  &nbsp; • <b>Therefore, the inbound logistics total is £2780 x 208 =  £578,240 per annum.</b><br>
<b>Operational Costs</b> - production costs: <br> 
  &nbsp; • N/A as it's covered in the fixed costs. <br>
<b>Outbound Logistics</b> - delivery/handling costs: <br>
  &nbsp; • Looking at other companies' delivery costs of equipment of similar weight, 
  we project the delivery and handling costs to be around <b>£40 per unit</b>, which's a fairly cruel estimate. <br>
  &nbsp; • Accounting for the delivery of 208 units, <b>the outbound logistics total comes to around £40 * 208 = £8,320 per annum.</b><br>
<b>Customer Services</b> - labour costs:<br>

   This is only around <b>3% of the £27,750,000 cost of human assistance</b>. <br><br>

   We first assume the purchasing option would be narrowed down to purchasing each unit independently, at least to begin with. 
   Since our total costs per annum are estimated to be around £819,560 assuming the production of 208 units (i.e. <b>£3,940 per unit</b>),  
   we will set <b>a price of £5,000 per unit</b>. <br><br>
  
  Assuming the sale of 208 such units a year, the <b>revenue stream should be around £1,040,000 per annum</b> (around 4% of the human cost per annum). 
  This makes for a <b>profit of roughly £220,440 per annum.</b>

  <div class="w3-container" style="padding: 25px; word-wrap: break-word; "> 
  <p class="w3-quarter " style="margin:1%;  width:23%"> 
  We met at the beginning of each sprint. 
  We would break down the milestones of the sprint into tasks, 
  and would arrange ourselves into teams depending on the ongoing tasks. 
  Using Trello, individuals were assigned those tasks.
  Most teams remained the same across various sprints and some teams were rearranged when needed. 
   </p>
   <p class="w3-quarter " style="margin:1%; width:23% ">
   At the end of each sprint, each team wrote a Nuclino page with instructions on how they accomplished their tasks and problems they faced, 
   alongisde their solutions and likely causes. This is so if members of a team would become unavailable at some point in the future, 
   other members of the group can build on top of what it's already built with the already-existing work fully documented. </p>

   <p class="w3-quarter " style="margin:1%;   width:23%">
   Team meetings and meetings with the mentor took place on a weekly basis. 
   To keep every member of the team up to date with other members' work, the team had daily scrums over Slack. 
   The 'scrum window' would last for 2 hours. In this window, each member writes what they have done since the last scrum, 
   what they are currently working on and what they'll work on next. Daily scrums allowed all members of the team to be aware of 
   occuring problems immediately, instead of delaying problems to the weekly meetings. 

   </p>
   <p class="w3-quarter " style="margin:1%; width:23%">
   Development tools used included git to manage the working files, which were maintained on a Github repository. 
   Trello was also used to assign tasks and deadlines to each member at the beginning of each sprint. 
   Slack was used for daily communication.
